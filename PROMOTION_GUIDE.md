**Body:**
```
Hey everyone! 👋

I built PromptCraft (https://promtcraft.in) - a free tool that makes your AI prompts way better.

**Why I built it:**
I was frustrated typing mediocre prompts into ChatGPT and getting mediocre results. So I built this using AWS Bedrock (Claude AI) to automatically enhance any prompt.

**What it does:**
• Takes your rough idea (e.g., "write a blog post")
• Transforms it into a professional prompt with context, constraints, and clarity
• Works with ChatGPT, Claude, GPT-5, Gemini, etc.
• 100% free, no signup, no BS

**Example:**
Input: "write a blog post about AI"
Output: A detailed 200-word prompt with role-playing, context, format specifications, etc.

**Tech stack:** AWS Lambda, Bedrock (Claude 3 Haiku), S3, CloudFront
**Cost:** ~$0.0004 per prompt (incredibly cheap)

Try it out and let me know what you think! Also open to feedback/feature requests.

2. Sign up with Google account
3. Enter website: promtcraft.in
4. Wait 1-2 weeks for approval

**Step 2: Ad Placement Strategy**

```html
<!-- Add to frontend/index.html -->

<!-- Top Banner Ad (after header) -->
<div class="ad-container" style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXX"
       crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
  <ins class="adsbygoogle"
       style="display:block"
       data-ad-client="ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXX"
       data-ad-slot="XXXXXXXXXX"
       data-ad-format="auto"
       data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
  <script>
       (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
  </script>
</div>

<!-- Sidebar Ad (right side) -->
<div class="ad-sidebar" style="position: fixed; right: 20px; top: 200px; width: 300px;">
  <ins class="adsbygoogle"
       style="display:block"
       data-ad-client="ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXX"
       data-ad-slot="XXXXXXXXXX"
       data-ad-format="auto"></ins>
  <script>
       (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
  </script>
</div>

<!-- In-Content Ad (after prompt generator) -->
<div class="ad-container" style="text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;">
  <ins class="adsbygoogle"
       style="display:block"
       data-ad-client="ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXX"
       data-ad-slot="XXXXXXXXXX"
       data-ad-format="auto"></ins>
  <script>
       (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
  </script>
</div>
```

**Expected Revenue:**
- 1,000 visitors/day = $5-15/day
- 10,000 visitors/day = $50-150/day
